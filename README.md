# Knapsack_metaheuristics
This program aims to calculate various metaheuristic algorithms applied to the “Knapsack Problem”. 
The Knapsack Problem is a combinatorial optimization maximization problem which requires to find the number of each weighted item to be included in a hypothetical knapsack, so the total weight is less than or equal to the required weight. To come to an optimized solution for such a problem, a variety of algorithms can possibly be used. In this paper, Tabu Search, Scatter Search and Local Search algorithms are compared taking execution time, solution quality and relative difference to best known quality, as metrics to compute the results of this NP-hard problem.
The idea is to Input the max weight you've in you knapsack and the number n of all objects you have , second you should insert in table T with each object the outcome and weight of it , third we sorted the table in a decrease way by the outcome of every object , forth we chose the best one from table [0-n] , if tab[n][2] < max of weight we choise it , else we dont .
